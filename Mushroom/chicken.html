                    <h2>Chicken of the Woods</h2>
                    <p>The Forest’s Poultry Substitute</p>

                <p>
                    Chicken of the Woods (<em>Laetiporus sulphureus</em>) is one of the most striking wild mushrooms. 
                    Its bold orange and yellow shelves fan out from tree trunks, sometimes appearing in massive 
                    clusters that weigh several kilograms. The sight of it is breathtaking, but what makes it 
                    even more remarkable is its reputation as a meat substitute. When cooked, its firm, fibrous 
                    texture and savory flavor resemble chicken so closely that it has earned its name from both 
                    foragers and chefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Culinary enthusiasts prize Chicken of the Woods as a versatile ingredient. It can be sautéed, 
                    fried, grilled, or simmered in soups, where it soaks up flavors beautifully while maintaining 
                    its hearty bite. For vegetarians or those looking to reduce meat consumption, this mushroom 
                    provides a natural alternative that feels and tastes surprisingly familiar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the forest, Chicken of the Woods plays a crucial ecological role. As a wood-decaying fungus, 
                    it helps break down dead or weakened trees, enriching the soil and allowing new growth to 
                    thrive. While delicious, caution is advised — it should always be thoroughly cooked, and 
                    some individuals may be sensitive to it. Still, for many, this mushroom represents the 
                    perfect intersection of culinary joy and ecological wonder.

            <!-- Identification Guide -->

                <h2>Identification Guide</h2>
                <img src="images/chicken2.jpg" alt="Chicken of the Woods Identification">
                <p>
                    <strong>Chicken of the Woods</strong> is an easily identifiable mushroom due to its 
                    vibrant yellow to deep orange coloring and large, overlapping, fan-shaped shelves. 
                    The edges are often bright yellow when fresh, gradually fading with age. 
                    This fungus grows primarily on hardwood trees such as oak, cherry, and beech, but may 
                    also appear on some conifers — although those specimens are often avoided due to 
                    potential digestive issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The surface texture starts smooth and slightly velvety, becoming chalky or brittle 
                    as it matures. When young, the flesh is soft and juicy, but older specimens tend 
                    to be tougher and less palatable. The undersides lack gills and instead feature tiny 
                    pores that release spores. Seasonally, Chicken of the Woods can appear from late 
                    spring through early autumn, depending on climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always confirm your identification with multiple sources before consumption, as 
                    misidentification can lead to health risks. Avoid specimens that are overly old, 
                    growing on poisonous trees such as yew, or have an unpleasant odor. For the best 
                    culinary experience, harvest young, tender clusters, and cook thoroughly to 
                    neutralize any potential irritants.
